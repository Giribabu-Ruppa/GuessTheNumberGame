Hereâ€™s a sample **README.md** file for a "Guess the Number" Python project on GitHub:

---

# **Guess the Number** ðŸŽ²  

A simple Python game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen number within a specified range. This project is a fun way to demonstrate Python programming basics like loops, conditionals, and random number generation.

---

## **Features**  
- Randomly generates a number for the player to guess.  
- Provides hints if the guessed number is too high or too low.  
- Tracks the number of attempts made by the player.  
- Customizable range for the random number generation.  

---

## **How to Run**  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/guess-the-number.git
   cd guess-the-number
   ```

2. **Run the Game**  
   Ensure you have Python installed. Use the following command:  
   ```bash
   python guess_the_number.py
   ```

---

## **Gameplay Instructions**  
1. The program generates a random number within a specific range (default: 1 to 100).  
2. Enter your guesses when prompted.  
3. The program will provide feedback:  
   - "Too High!" if your guess is greater than the number.  
   - "Too Low!" if your guess is less than the number.  
4. Continue guessing until you find the correct number.  
5. The program will display the number of attempts you made.

---

## **Customization**  
You can modify the range of numbers by editing the following lines in the script:  
```python
LOWER_LIMIT = 1
UPPER_LIMIT = 100
```

---

## **Example**  
```plaintext
Welcome to Guess the Number!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Enter your guess: 50
Too low!
Enter your guess: 75
Too high!
Enter your guess: 62
Congratulations! You guessed it in 3 tries.
```
